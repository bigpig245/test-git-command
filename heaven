Ooh thinking about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me coming back for more

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Ooh once in your life you'll find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you feeling down
Yeah nothing can change what you mean to me
Ooh there's a lot that I can say
But just hold me now
Cuz our love will light the way

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

I've been waiting for so long
For something to arrive
Love to come along
Now our dreams are coming true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
Love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't to hard to see
We're in heaven...

You're all that I want
You're all that I need

Ooh thinking about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
